# Pizza-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-in-Excel

This dashboard was designed to analyze the sales performance of a pizza restaurant and help management understand sales trends, best-selling products, and customer behavior based on time. The dataset includes pizza sales transactions with details such as product name, category, size, price, order date and time, and total sales value.

## Key features of the dashboard include:
- Total Sales, Total Orders, Total Quantity, and Average Order Value
- Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas
- Sales performance by Category, Pizza Size, and Pizza Type
- Monthly, Daily, and Hourly Sales Trends

The dashboard also includes interactive slicers for Pizza Category and Pizza Size, allowing users to explore sales performance from different perspectives. Built using Microsoft Excel 2019, the dashboard applies a modern and clean design with a green–yellow color theme to reflect a pizza store’s visual identity and enhance readability.

Example Insight:
Large-sized pizzas contributed the most to total sales (45.9%), with peak sales occurring between 12 PM and 2 PM during lunchtime.

This project demonstrates my ability in data cleaning, data visualization, and storytelling using Excel, focusing on delivering clear and actionable business insights for decision-making.
